# Introduction
AB-GEP is a novel algorithm based on an adversarial bandit technique. AB-GEP segments the mathematical space into many subspaces. It then leverages a new selection method, AvgExp3, to enhance the population jump between segmented subspaces while avoiding falling into a local optimum.
